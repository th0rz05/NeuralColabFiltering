# Production Pipeline Guidelines for the Recommendation System

This document provides detailed guidelines on how to maintain, update, and serve the recommendation system in production. It covers daily tasks, real-time operations, and special procedures for handling new users and new games.

## 1. Daily Tasks

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Collect New Data:**  
  - Continuously ingest user interaction data (e.g., play durations, click logs, session data).
  - Collect updated metadata for slots (games), if available.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
  - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize interaction signals.
  - Map user and game IDs to consecutive indices.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Update derived features such as normalized scores, recency, frequency, etc.
  
### Model Retraining
- **Schedule Daily Retraining:**  
  - Run the training pipeline daily (or at another regular interval) using the most recent interaction data.
  - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Monitor validation loss and ranking metrics (Hit Rate, NDCG) to ensure model quality.
  - Use early stopping to avoid overfitting.
- **Embedding Extraction & FAISS Index Update:**  
  - Once the model is retrained, extract updated slot embeddings.
  - Rebuild and update the FAISS index with the new embeddings.

### Reporting & Monitoring
- **Generate Daily Reports:**  
  - Log training and validation loss values.
  - Record changes in ranking metrics and compare them against historical performance.
- **Dashboard Updates:**  
  - Update monitoring dashboards with new model metrics and performance KPIs (e.g., user engagement, CTR).

## 2. Real-Time Operations

### Real-Time Recommendation Serving
- **Instant Recommendations:**  
  - Use the pre-built FAISS index for lightning-fast nearest neighbor queries based on slot embeddings.
  - For a user who is currently active, quickly retrieve similar slots based on their most recent activity.
- **Adaptive Filtering:**  
  - Exclude slots the user has already interacted with using the `user_positive` mapping.
- **API Serving:**  
  - Deploy RESTful or GraphQL endpoints that serve recommendations in real time.
  - Ensure low latency responses (in the order of milliseconds).

### Monitoring & Error Handling
- **Real-Time Logging:**  
  - Log real-time query metrics (e.g., response time, errors).
  - Monitor usage patterns to detect anomalies or performance issues.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:**  
  - Implement fallback strategies (e.g., default popular slots) in case of index or service failure.

## 3. Handling New Users

### Cold-Start Strategy
- **Initial Onboarding Survey:**  
  - Consider asking new users a few preference questions during registration.
- **Popular Slots Recommendation:**  
  - For users with no historical data, recommend a mix of popular slots or ones that are generally well-rated.
- **Rapid Data Collection:**  
  - Once the user interacts with a few slots, quickly incorporate their behavior into the system.
- **Progressive Personalization:**  
  - Gradually transition from cold-start recommendations to personalized recommendations as more data becomes available.

## 4. Handling New Games

### New Game Introduction Process
- **Metadata Collection:**  
  - Gather detailed metadata about the new game (e.g., theme, volatility, RTP).
- **Similarity Analysis:**  
  - Compare the new gameâ€™s features to existing games to estimate initial similarity scores.
- **Targeted Exploration:**  
  - Push the new game as an exploratory recommendation to a small segment of users to collect interaction data.
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Monitor user engagement with the new game closely.
  - Update its embedding and incorporate it into the FAISS index during the next retraining cycle.
- **Gradual Integration:**  
  - If the new game performs well, increase its visibility in recommendations across the platform.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

### A/B Testing & Feedback
- **Conduct A/B Tests:**  
  - Regularly test different recommendation strategies (e.g., varying the balance between model predictions and recent activity).
  - Compare user engagement, conversion rates, and satisfaction metrics.
- **User Feedback Integration:**  
  - Incorporate user feedback to adjust recommendation algorithms.
  - Refine cold-start, exploration, and personalization strategies over time.

### System Maintenance & Scalability
- **Modular Codebase:**  
  - Ensure that the code is modular, well-documented, and easily maintainable.
- **Automation & CI/CD:**  
  - Automate the retraining, evaluation, and deployment pipelines.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to quickly roll out updates and fixes.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Plan for scalability in both the training and serving components to handle increasing user loads.
